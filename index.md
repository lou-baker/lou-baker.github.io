Hello! I am currently a postdoc at the University of Washington working with [Michelle DiBenedetto](https://www.michellediben.com), where I study the vertical mixing and transport of microplastic particles in wind-driven turbulence at the ocean surface through laboratory experiments and numerical models. I received my PhD from the University of Minnesota, where I worked with Filippo Coletti in the [Laboratories for Turbulent and Complex Flows](https://cse.umn.edu/aem/laboratories-turbulent-and-complex-flows) and the [St. Anthony Falls Lab](https://cse.umn.edu/safl) to explore fluid-particle interactions in boundary layer turbulence. When I'm not in the lab I like to [read](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/70817449-luci) and be outdoors.
