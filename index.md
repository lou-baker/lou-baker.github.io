# optional portfolio section ------------------------------------------

# By declaring these variables, you can include a portfolio showcasing your work and organize your portfolio's items into a custom layout, all without adding any CSS. In addition, you must 1) create an HTML file in the_includes folder for each project with the text you'd like to display, and 2) create a YAML file in the _data folder describing the order in which each project should be shown and categorized. See `/includes/example.html` and `/_data/work.yml` for examples.

portfolio: research # the heading for your portfolio and title of your YAML file
# portfolio_description: publications on <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=hynPacUAAAAJ&hl=en">Google Scholar</a> # a description to be desplayed below the heading and above the content

I use lab-based experiments to study how particles move in turbulent flows. 

My [postdoc research](https://www.me.washington.edu/news/article/2022-07-29/how-do-microplastics-behave-ocean-surface) in the Environmental Fluid Mechanics group at the University of Washington focuses on the vertical mixing and orientation of microplastic particles in wind-driven waves and turbulence in the ocean surface boundary layer. I received my PhD in Aerospace Engineering & Mechanics from the University of Minnesota, where I explored fluid-particle interactions in turbulence. 

In my free time I enjoy dancing and [creative writing](https://notesfromtheinflectionpoint.substack.com/).
